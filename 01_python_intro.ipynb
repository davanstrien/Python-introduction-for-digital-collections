    " \n",
    "This series of notebooks aims to provide an introduction to things that can be achieved fairly easily with Python. The examples are framed around work with digital collections. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims \n",
    "The aims of the notebooks/lesson are primarily:\n",
    "- to help you decide whether it might be worth your time learning *some* Python\n",
    "- Give you some ideas for some ways in which you can approach *how* to learn Python for the purpose of working with collections items\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non aims (is that a thing!?) \n",
    "- to teach you Python in a few hours\n",
    "- teach you to become a software engineer. The way in which you might use Python for tackling practical problems in your work might not always fit with best practices from software engineering. It is still very worthwhile trying to learn these concepts but not at the expense of getting useful things done. \n",

    "- Why Python? \n",
    "- Some Python syntax \n",

    "# Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are many programming languages you could potentially choose to learn. Some of the languages are widely used and underpin a broad range of software (and hardware) you use on a day-to-day basis. \n",
    "- Other languages are primarily used in one very specific field either because they work particularly well for that task or as a result of legacy systems (you can earn big üí≤ working as an IT contractor in banking if you know COBOL, a language first developed in the 60s which still powers a lot of banking systems and few people now know)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some reasons why Python could be a good choice as a programming language to learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a programming language refers to the rules a language follows to combine symbols and sequences i.e. how you write commands to the computer. Let's look at an example for printing ```Hello, world!```\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Python: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "print('Hello, world!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### In C:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main(void)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    printf(\"hello, world\\n\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that there is a lot less required as code to get Python to do the same thing. This is not an exclusive property of Python. Some programming languages are 'high level', others are 'low level'. A high level language usually has an easier to understand syntax. In this case 'C' can be considered a lower level language. This often requires you to be more explicit about how you want a machine to do something whilst a higher level language can \n",
    "\n",
    "Another toy example of Python syntax \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "files = ['2019_12_10_visitor_stats.csv', '2019_10_10_visitor_stats.csv', '2020_01_01_visitor_stats.csv','draft_proposal.docx']\n",
    "for file in files:\n",
    "    if '2019' in file:\n",
    "        print(file)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With a bit of luck you'll be able to follow what is happening here even if you don't know Python yet. One of the nice things about python is that it often possible to understand what's happening in some Python code even if you couldn't necessarily write the same code yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ü§´ You will read more code than you write \n",
    "\n",
    "Your typing speed is unlikely to be the barrier to how quickly you can code (at least for some time). Instead you will often be trying to work out how to do things in Python using a combination of your code and code written by other people. Being able to understand the syntax of code will make it much easier for you to work out what code you can borrow and adapt from other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adoption \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is widely used which means you will find plenty of resources for using it. It also makes it more likely that other people you work with may know some (or a lot) of it too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also used widely accross a broad range of domains (research and industry) and for a broad range of applications (web development, data science, networking, databases...) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries \n",
    "Python has loads of software libraries. These libraries help you do a whole range of things more easily in Python. This ranges from [tools for working with marc](https://pypi.org/project/pymarc/) to [astronomy](https://www.astropy.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why not Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are downsides to Python too. Some reasons you may not want to use Python:\n",
    "- if you are want to focus on 'front-end' web development you will want to learn javascript and HTML/CSS (this doesn't mean you can't use Python to build websites) \n",
    "- if performance/speed is critical for what you are doing, there are many ways to speed up Python code but if absolute performance is critical then you may want to consider another language. This is likely to be an issue in a heritage context (think algorithmic trading)\n",
    "- your colleagues all use another language (it might be more useful to be able to get help) \n",
    "- you want to use other languages (there are plenty of other languages to learn üòÄ)"
